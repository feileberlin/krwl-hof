⚠️  COPILOT/AGENT WARNING ⚠️
================================

This directory contains AUTO-GENERATED files that should NOT be edited directly.

🚫 AGENTS MUST NOT:
   - Edit index.html, css/style.css, or js/app.js directly
   - Create helper scripts to modify these files
   - Make changes without going through the generator

✅ TO MAKE CHANGES:
   1. Edit the templates in: src/modules/generator.py
   2. Run the generator: python3 src/main.py generate
   3. The generator will check for conflicts and warn before overwriting

📋 FILES THAT ARE SAFE TO EDIT:
   - config.json (app configuration data)
   - events.json (event data)
   - Other non-generated assets

🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY GENERATED FILES:
   Look for these comments at the top of files:
   - HTML: <!-- AUTO-GENERATED: This file is generated from src/modules/generator.py -->
   - CSS:  /* AUTO-GENERATED: This file is generated from src/modules/generator.py */
   - JS:   // AUTO-GENERATED: This file is generated from src/modules/generator.py

⚡ GENERATOR HAS BUILT-IN PROTECTION:
   - Detects manual changes before regeneration
   - Prompts for confirmation before overwriting
   - Shows which files will be affected
