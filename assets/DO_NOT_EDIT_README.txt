⚠️  WARNING: AUTO-GENERATED FILE ⚠️
=======================================

The following file in this directory is AUTO-GENERATED by the build system:
  - index.html (generated from CDN resources + app files)

This file is regenerated from:
  - src/modules/cdn_inliner.py (generation logic)
  - static/css/style.css (app styles)
  - static/js/app.js (app logic)
  - CDN: Leaflet CSS and JS

🚫 DO NOT manually edit index.html directly!
   Any manual changes will be OVERWRITTEN during the next build.

✅ To make changes:
   1. Edit app styles in static/css/style.css
   2. Edit app logic in static/js/app.js
   3. Run: python3 src/main.py generate
   4. Commit all changed files

📋 Data files are safe to edit:
   - events.json (published events)
   - pending_events.json (events awaiting review)
   - rejected_events.json (rejected events)
   - config.json (runtime configuration)
   - content.json / content.de.json (translations)
