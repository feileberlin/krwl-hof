## 📝 About This Documentation

### Works Anywhere!
All documentation files are standard markdown that work:
- ✅ On GitHub (just browse the files)
- ✅ In your text editor (VS Code, vim, whatever you use)
- ✅ Locally after cloning
- ✅ In GitHub Wiki (automatically synced)

No special setup needed. Click links and read!

### Automatically Synced to Wiki
When changes are merged to `main`, documentation is automatically synced to the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/feileberlin/krwl-hof/wiki). You can read it either way - same content, your choice.

**First-time setup needed?** If you're the repository owner and the Wiki is empty, see **[Wiki Setup Guide](WIKI_SETUP.md)** for the one-time initialization step.
